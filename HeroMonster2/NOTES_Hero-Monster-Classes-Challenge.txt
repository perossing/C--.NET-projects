*** As with many of the lessons in this series, the provided solution was lacking in several aspects: ***

It repeatedly displayed Name, Health, Max Damage, and Attack Bonus, three of which never change.

The one thing that changed in the repeated displays was health, which is a result of the attack & damage.  The attack and the random damage number that make the game somewhat interesting were buried in the code and never displayed.

There was also never any explanation of why there would be an Attack Bonus, and this never showed up in the display when if it was used.

The name "damage" is also a really poor variable name because it does not distinguish between damage that is given or damage that is taken, which can lead to a lot of confusion.


*** I made the following changes: ***
1) Display name, health (relabled 'Starting Health'), Max Damage (renamed MaxAttackForce), and Bonus Attack, are displayed together only at the start of the game.
2) Display whether the first attack is a bonus.
3) Display who is attacking in each round followed by the results.
4) Track and display the attackForce (= damageTaken) with each attack.
These changes make the results of the game much more interesting and at least provide some reasoning for why one would write such a program, even as an exercise.

In addition, I extracted and abstracted several methods for more readable and less rambling code.
