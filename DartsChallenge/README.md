# Two-Player Dart Game

- Object-Oriented project with multiple classes with properties and methods
    * 'Dart' to determine area of board hit (wedge, ring, bullseye)
    * 'Player' designated which player to assign turns & scores to
    * 'Score' to calculate scoring	
    * 'Game' controls play of game with display of results
- One class created and imported as external library
- Each player gets three throws per round
- Random numbers generated to determine region of board hit on each throw
- Scoring calculated:
    * number wedge: points = wedge #
    * triple ring and double ring: points = wedge # times 3 or 2
    * bullseye = 25 points
    * inner bullseye = 
- 'Play Game' button displays results of each round and final scores with winner

Added to original project specs:
- display of specific wedge/band on each hit
- display of points for individual throws as well as running total
