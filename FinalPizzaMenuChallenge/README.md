#C# / .NET Pizza Menu Challenge

A lesson in **Object Oriented programming, separation of concerns, database tables, and form validation**

**_Note:_**
The completed code in these files is not 100% show original work.  After completing the project on my own, I ultimately replaced the majority of the project with new code built while studying the project-solution videos.

Going through the process of working on individual parts was excellent practice for creating classes and general application structure, but I ultimately needed to change my approach and follow the solution in order to clean up the code and make the project function better.
